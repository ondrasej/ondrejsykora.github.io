Fantom is an implementation of the board game Scotland Yard for the seminar on applied artificial intelligence. The main purpose of this implementation is to serve as a test-bed for AI research and testing various methods for controlling the agents.

It does not have any user interface, but on the other hand it has a client-server architecture, a clearly defined communication protocol between the agents and the game and a library for implementing your own agents.
