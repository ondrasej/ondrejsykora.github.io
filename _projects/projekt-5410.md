Projekt 5410 is a 2.5D scrolling shooter game, inspired by games like [Xenon II:
Megablast](http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/xenon-2-megablast) or [Raptor:
Call of the
Shadows](http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/raptor-call-of-the-shadows). By the
time we started thinking about
the game, there were almost no new games of that genre. We decided to create
our own, re-create the classical gameplay by using new technologies, such as 3D
hardware acceleration.

This is a game that goes through the whole history of [Trion
team](http://trionteam.net/) - it was the first game planned by the team back
in 1999. And while we never did officially announce the end of the project or
demise of the team, there was very little activity since 2004. Though the
project is far from finished, we got quite far, having an almost complete
engine that supports most features required by the game:

* Graphical engine with BSP trees and particle systems,
* Audio playback for sound and background music,
* Game engine with everything necessary to create levels, add enemies, bonuses
  and other goodies,
* [TLisp](/projects/tlisp/) for configuration and creating levels.

What we lacked was a rigid game design, and we never had a reasonable design
document. We had a strong idea of what the game should look like, but it proved
to be hard to transfer to other people, when Tom Jukl (responsible for graphics
and most of design) went to army service and mostly stopped working on the
game.

We've created a few demos, that can be downloaded from the [Trion
team](http://trionteam.net) web site. There's a much more complete unofficial
version I've used as a school project with Michal Tuálček, Maroš Kasinec and
Peter Sabolčák, though it was never released due to copyrighted music score.
